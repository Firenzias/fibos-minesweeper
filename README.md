# fibos-minesweeper
Fibonacci's version of minesweeper

This is a small project quest by one of IT company from Brno. This project is meant to demonstrate my skills regarding algoritmization and stuff.

**Technical Assessment**

_Create a grid of 50x50. When you click on a cell, all values in the cells in the same row and column are increased  by 1. If a cell is empty, it will get a value of 1. After each change a cell will briefly turn yellow. If 5 consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are next to each other, these cells will briefly turn green and will be cleared. Use the programming language of your choice._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
